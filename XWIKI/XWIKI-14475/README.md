Analysis
========

* JIRA issue: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14475
* The real problem is actually not in `DefaultWikiTemplateManager` but in `DefaultWikiPropertyGroupManager` which gets injected `Map<String, WikiPropertyGroupProvider> propertyGroupProviders` once (when the singleton is loaded the first time). The issue is when `xwiki-platform-wiki-*` modules are installed as extensions (when provisioning a new subwiki for example).
* It's not possible for EvoCrash to know about this since `DefaultWikiPropertyGroupManager` doesn't appear in the stack trace anywhere...
* The test generated by EvoCrash is not that useful in this case since it's easier to understand the code than the generated test
* However, what's nice with test generated by EvoCrash is that it makes it easier to understand some conditions that can lead to a problem. The developer still needs to figure out the real reason of the problem and write a proper test but it can help.
