Analysis
========

* JIRA issue: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13372
* This is a very simple case
* The test generated by EvoCrash does reproduce the problem. But it's also very easy to do that manually without EvoCrash (takes less time than executing EvoCrash)
* In practice a real test would need to have several cases tested: an equals that returns true and another one that returns false. Both with different property set (for ex by removing one prop and adding another one)
* Actually the JIRA issue had some info already so it would have been very easy for a dev to create a test case with the input suggetsed in the jira issue and reproduce the problem.
* However assuming that there was just a stack trace without additional info, finding the issue would have needed either:
 * to reproduce the use case which would have taken a long time (manual test setup)
 * to figure out in which case the code can be null, which is when the passed param is null and that's quite easy to figure out
* Thus in this case EvoCrash can help but doesn't bring a high value.
